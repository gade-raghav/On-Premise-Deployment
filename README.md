## Installation and Usage Instructions

Tools/Softwares/Services used:

- Kubernetes using Microk8s

- Lens (IDE for Kubernetes) 

- Helm/Helm Charts

- Parse Server

- Prometheus 

- Grafana

- Weavely Cloud

- GitHub

### Pre-requisites

**Note**: I am solving this problem on my local machine as I do not have access to any Cloud services.

Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTE

### Steps

#### Kubernetes Setup using [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/docs):
Initially, we need to set up Kubernetes :

Install microk8s :

`sudo snap install microk8s --classic`

`sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER`

`sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube`

This will give us Kubectl command-line tool and Kube config file.

Add an alias in .bashrc as follows to make things simpler:

`alias kubectl="microk8s.kubectl"`


Run `source .bashrc` after making changes to .bashrc file.

Incase the config file doesn't exist in ~/.kube directory follow the steps below

`
microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
`

Extra careful while giving read, write and execute permissions 

`chmod 700 ~/.kube/config`

Now let's run the Kubernetes cluster

`microk8s start`

Check status using the following commands and make sure everything is running.

![microk8s status](/images/microk8sstatus.png)

`kubectl get nodes` (Check if the node is ready. We are using a single node.)

`kubectl get all --all-namespaces`

![kubectl get all](/images/kubectlgetall.png)


#### [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) Setup:

Lens is an IDE for working Kubernetes clusters. You just need to pass in the kube config file and it takes care of the rest.

[Installing Lens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/releases/tag/v3.6.7)

I have downloaded the AppImage which is extremely easy to use. After download give executable permissions to file and run using the following command

`./Lens-3.6.6.AppImage`

![Lens install](/images/Lens.png)

Provide the path to Kubernetes config file and it gets all the information about the cluster.


#### [Helm](https://helm.sh/) Setup:

Helm is the Package Manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

[Installing helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

I prefer installing it from the script.

Helm now has an installer script that will automatically grab the latest version of Helm and install it locally.

Run the following commands:

`curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3`

`chmod 700 get_helm.sh`

`./get_helm.sh`


#### [Parse Server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) Setup:

Parse Server is an open-source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

We are going to set up parse server using helm charts. [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/) has a lot of Kubernetes packages.
Search for the required package and it provides us with clear instructions about how to use it. We can also do it using the command line as follows.

Repo used for pulling parse chart: Bitnami

Bitnami makes it easy to get your favorite open source software up and running on any platform, including your laptop, Kubernetes, and all the major clouds.

Pull Bitnami repo

`helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

![helm repo add](/images/helmaddrepo.png)

Search for the parse package

`helm search repo parse`

![helm search parse](/images/helmsearchparse.png)

We will use bitnami/parse which is stable

Let's inspect the values of bitnami/parse chart

`helm inspect values bitnami/parse >> ~/atlanwork/parse.values`

![helm inspect parse](/images/helmiparse.png)

We need to change the service type from LoadBalance to NodePort as we are running it in a local environment. Make the following changes (type: NodePort)

![parse configuration](/images/parseconf.png)

Create a namespace which makes monitoring easy

`kubectl create namespace parse`


**Deploying parse server using helm chart**

name: parse-server 

namespace: parse

`helm install parse-server bitname/parse --values parse.values -n parse`

![parse install](/images/parseinstall.png)

Wait for some time until the parse-server is deployed. Check the status on Lens which is user-friendly.

Now we need to follow the instructions provided by bitnami chart i.e to get the port numbers from services deployed.

Run the following commands

![export commands](/images/aftermathparse.png)

Finally, make a curl request 

`
curl -X POST \
-H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"score":1337,"playerName":"Sean Plott","cheatMode":false}' \
http://$SERVICE_HOST/parse/classes/GameScore
`

You should get a response similar to this:

`
{
  "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK",
  "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z"
}
`

#### [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) Setup :

Prometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.

Now things get a little interesting. We can set up Prometheus from scratch using helm just like we set up parse-server. However, since 
we installed Lens we can just do it with a click!

![install prometheus](/images/installprometheus.png)

Background workflow when we click *install*

- lens-metrics namespace is created
- helm is used to setup prometheus from stable/prometheus helm-chart with metrics enabled (this saves a lot of time metrics are automatically enabled which is a huge bonus)

![prometheus firing up](images/prometheussetup.png)

Check the status of lens-metrics namespace and then we can access prometheus from the pod just by a click.

![metrics](/images/prometheusmetrics.png)


#### [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) Setup:

Grafana has become the worldâ€™s most popular technology used to compose observability dashboards with everything from Prometheus & Graphite metrics, to logs and application data to power plants and beehives

We will be using this amazing tool to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics no matter where they are stored.
In plain English, it provides you with tools to turn your time-series database (TSDB) data into beautiful graphs and visualizations.

We will setup grafana using helm charts as well

Search for the grafana package

`helm search repo grafana`

![helm search grafana](/images/helmgrafanasearch.png)

We will use bitnami/grafana which is stable

Let's inspect the values of bitnami/grafana chart

`helm inspect values bitnami/grafana >> ~/atlanwork/grafana.values`

We need to change the service type from LoadBalance to NodePort as we are running it in a local environment.Make the following changes (nodePort: --your-choice(between 30000-32767) type: NodePort)

Create a namespace which makes monitoring easy

`kubectl create namespace grafana`

![helm namespace grafana](/images/helmnamespacegrafana.png)

**Deploying grafana using helm chart**

name: grafana

namespace: grafana

`helm install grafana bitname/grafana --values grafana.values -n grafana`

![helm install grafana](/images/helminstallgrafana.png)

Wait for some time until the grafana is deployed. Check the status on Lens which is user-friendly.

Now we need to follow the instructions provided by bitnami chart i.e to get the port numbers from services deployed.

Run the following commands

![export commands](/images/aftermathgrafana.png)


#### [Weavely](https://www.weave.works/product/cloud/) Setup:

Weave Cloud is an automation and management platform for development and DevOps teams.

**NOTE**: We will take a free-trail account to demonstrate the use case.

Login to weave cloud and add a cluster

We have to select
- platform: Kubernetes(in our case)
- environment: Generic Kubernetes(in our case)
- install using helm 

![connect cluster](/images/weave1.png)

![](/images/weave2.png)
![](/images/weave3.png)
![](/images/weave4.png)
![](/images/weavenamespace.png)
![](/images/helmweave.png)

***Before helm installation, create a namespace "weave" in Kubernetes as it is a pre-requisite.***

Now we can add our GitHub repo for setting up CI/CD pipeline. Go to settings>configure and add our GitHub repo URL.

![weave setup complete](/images/weaveperfect.png)

Weavly offers prometheus and grafana monitoring as well, however, we already have a reliable local setup.

Installation and Setup are complete.


## Use Cases and Edge Conditions

- The entire deployment has been done using a local setup and the same can be replicated in the cloud environment if given access.

- Cluster is managed by nodeports and not loadbalancer as we are not using any cloud services.

- Helm charts used for deployment has minimum required parameters enabled, however, they can be changed using values.yaml file as per requirement.

- Since helm charts are used for deployment, they are very reliable and hence require minimal edit to charts. So every commit coming from the remote git source repo is already code analyzed.



## Workflow

We'll pick up the issues mentioned in the problem statements and elaborate on the workflow with images as well.

#### Ease of clustered enterprise-level deployments

On cloud, Kubernetes clusters can be created using terraform given access. I have experience in creating the Kubernetes cluster using terraform in case access is provided.
As far as application deployment is concerned, helm charts themselves can be installed on clustered Kubernetes, however, deployment configuration like helmsman and fluxcd can be used. Fluxcd supports the GitOps model wherein it would automatically update as soon as the new code is pushed.
The git repository aforementioned has the charts and templates which are used for application deployment in our case.

#### Incremental remotely triggered application updates

Weave cloud has been used to resolve this issue however configuration files have a huge role to play in triggering updates.
When we set up the Weavely cloud, we passed in our GitHub repo link. Every push to the repository will trigger a build and it will be deployed to Kubernetes cluster.

####  Remote Debugging 

Application logs can be pushed to a central entity like splunk. Metrics can be pushed to prometheus, SignalFx. Kubernetes supports daemon sets,prometheus, and SignalFx using which respective values of all pods on all nodes can be collected and pushed.
In our case, we have used Lens for the same.

#### Health alerts and monitoring

Prometheus, Grafana, and Weavely cloud have been collectively used to achieve health alerts and monitoring.
We have used Lens IDE which makes it extremely easy to setup prometheus.
Grafana has been set up from scratch using helm charts.
Weavly cloud also sets up prometheus and monitors all the metrics.


Prometheus provides various metrics for data visualization. It is passed as a data source for grafana.
![](/images/prometheuswebui.png)
![](/images/grafanadatasource.png)
We can enable various dashboards for monitoring various metrics provided by prometheus. We have enabled a particular dashboard and the following are the representations.
![](/images/grafanamonitoring1.png)
![](/images/grafanamonitoring2.png)

Weave cloud offers a fine monitoring system as well. It also sends an email for every alert which has been demonstrated by a demo alert email.

#### Application Security

We need to check node security and make sure un-necessary software is not installed on the nodes. To achieve this we can use CORE OS if our target is to just deploy a docker container.
On cloud, we can use RBAC across all Kubernetes components. For example, on AWS if a pod needs access to S3 bucket, it can be achieved by a service account with a role-based policy. This permits the specified pod no matter on what node it runs within the cluster.
It helps in achieving fine-grained access control.
External components like Lens can also be secured with roles.
Inter pod communication can be secured with mutual tls using istio.

#### Disaster Management

Velero an open-source project integrates with Kubernetes cluster and data storage to provide backup and restoration of native Kubernetes objects. The advantage with velero is that it backups up Kubernetes objects from etcd database.


## Data formats and Reporting

We receive the following metrics from prometheus and grafana. (All the metrics have not been mentioned as there was very minimal use case)

**Prometheus**

  - CPU Usage, Requests, Capacity, and Limits
  - Memory Usage, Requests, Capacity, and Limits
  - Pods Usage and Capacity
 
**Grafana**

  - CPU Usage
  - Memory Usage
  - All Processes networks I/O





## Performance and Scaling

Large Scaling is utilized when the traffic of workloads at hand is expanded and here we have Lens for making it truly simple to perform scaling by only a few clicks and edits.

The steps for scaling any component are as follows, however, I will be emphasizing Parse Server.

Go to Lens > Deployments and select parse-server.
![](/images/scale1.png)

Click on the edit option which will give you the deployment file.
![](/images/scale2.png)

Change replicas to the required number (2 in our case) and then save it.
![](/images/scale3.png)

We can see the deployment progressing and pods scaling.
![](/images/scale4.png)
![](/images/scale5.png)

Depending upon our requirement, we can have the pods scaled.

## Unresolved Issues

Incremental remotely triggered updates and Disaster management issue has been theoretically resolved but is not practically tested by me. However I have tested scaling the application and in the same lines, edits can be made to helm charts and pushed to git repo which will trigger CI/CD pipeline. I need to dig a little deeper and then try and test it practically. Moreover, I have not figured out disaster management issues and hence the above-mentioned tool velero is not tested in my project.
